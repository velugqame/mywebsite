Before we delve into what makes them so deserving of this title as the month's number one, let's talk about the group itself.</p><figure class="post__image"><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://velugqame.github.io/mywebsite/media/posts/1/the-lead.jfif" alt="" width="640" height="640"></figure><figcaption>FLO group memebrs: Jorja Douglas (L), Stella Quaresma (C), and Renée Downer (R) on the cover of their first EP, "The Lead".</figcaption></figure><p>The British girl group is comprised of three members based in London. They formed in 2019 under Island Records and debuted with a single titled "Cardboard Box". They went on to release their debut EP (extended play) in 2022 called "The Lead".  As of right now in 2024, they have performed 13 shows in both the UK and US as part of thewir 2023 tour, FLO Live. For a group that is still relatively new, they are extraordinarily confident onstage and they most certainly have the skills to justify it.</p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://velugqame.github.io/mywebsite/media/posts/1/FLO-London-Live.webp" alt="Flo Live in London" width="1200" height="800" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="https://velugqame.github.io/mywebsite/media/posts/1/responsive/FLO-London-Live-xs.webp 640w, https://velugqame.github.io/mywebsite/media/posts/1/responsive/FLO-London-Live-sm.webp 768w, https://velugqame.github.io/mywebsite/media/posts/1/responsive/FLO-London-Live-md.webp 1024w, https://velugqame.github.io/mywebsite/media/posts/1/responsive/FLO-London-Live-lg.webp 1366w, https://velugqame.github.io/mywebsite/media/posts/1/responsive/FLO-London-Live-xl.webp 1600w, https://velugqame.github.io/mywebsite/media/posts/1/responsive/FLO-London-Live-2xl.webp 1920w"><figcaption>FLO Live performance in London, England form 2023.</figcaption></figure><p>We continue to see the girls produce hit after hit and banger after banger. They have the perfect combination of visuals and vocals. Be it live or pre-recorded, FLO doesn't miss. Part of their success is definitely their chemistry as a group. From any clip of them, you can tell that they love what they do and who they're doing it with. It's clear based on their steady growing fanbase that they are worthy of thier success and this month's title.</p><p>So congratulations to FLO!</p></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by Publii</p></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="https://velugqame.github.io/mywebsite/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="https://velugqame.github.io/mywebsite/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=ffcbea6c02c8178d10092962b235a5b0"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
